                        When you/any other driver accept a hitcher's request to join your ride, the system automatically cancels any conflicting ride requests they may have made for the same ride. This prevents double-booking and ensures hitchhikers don't accidentally reserve multiple seats for the same journey. It helps maintain scheduling integrity and provides a better experience for everyone.

                        As a driver, you can schedule a maximum of 2 rides per day - one to college and one from college. This limit helps ensure quality service and prevents scheduling conflicts. Plan your rides accordingly to make the most of your available slots.

                        Not showing up for a scheduled ride without cancellation badly affects your reliability score. The penalty to your reliability rate is doubled compared to cancelling a ride. This policy encourages users to at least cancel rides they cannot fulfill rather than simply not showing up, which causes more inconvenience to other users.

                        When a driver accepts your request to join their ride, the system automatically cancels any other pending ride requests you may have made for the same day and direction. This prevents you from accidentally being assigned to multiple rides at once and helps ensure you don't miss rides you've committed to.

                        You can have up to 3 pending ride requests at a time for a particular day and direction. This limit allows you to explore multiple options while preventing excessive requests that might overload the system. Once a driver accepts one of your requests, your other pending requests for that day and direction will be automatically cancelled.

                        When browsing rides, you'll see drivers' reliability scores. Green (&gt;80%) indicates highly reliable drivers, yellow (60-80%) means moderate reliability, and red (&lt;60%) suggests caution. Choose drivers with higher scores for a better experience.

                        You can cancel a requested or approved ride from your dashboard. Try to cancel as early as possible to maintain a good reliability score. Frequent last-minute cancellations will lower your score and may affect your ability to join rides in the future.
