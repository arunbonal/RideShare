# Authentication System Updates

## Recent Changes

### OAuth Consent Screen Fix

We updated the Google OAuth implementation to correctly display "RideShare" in the OAuth consent screen instead of exposing the backend URL. The fixes include:

1. **Updated Passport.js Google Strategy Configuration**:
   - Changed to use relative URLs for callbacks
   - Added proper proxy support
   - Enabled passReqToCallback for better request handling

2. **Express Server Configuration**:
   - Added trust proxy setting to properly handle secure callbacks

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Modified GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL to use relative paths instead of absolute URLs
   - This ensures your backend URL isn't exposed in the OAuth consent screen

4. **New Documentation**:
   - Added detailed setup instructions in `docs/google-oauth-setup.md`

## Google Cloud Console Configuration

For the changes to take full effect, you'll need to:

1. Verify your app name is set to "RideShare" in the Google Cloud Console
2. Ensure all required fields are completed in the OAuth consent screen
3. Upload a proper app logo (128x128px minimum)
4. Add both your frontend and backend domains under "Authorized domains"

## Testing the OAuth Flow

After deploying these changes, test the OAuth flow in production to verify:
1. The OAuth consent screen shows "RideShare" instead of your backend URL
2. Authentication works correctly
3. Callbacks are properly handled

## Security Notes

- These changes don't expose any sensitive information
- The proxy setting ensures that secure callbacks work correctly behind a reverse proxy
- The trust proxy setting is important for production environments using HTTPS

Refer to `docs/google-oauth-setup.md` for detailed configuration instructions.
